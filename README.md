# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math library to use sqrt() function.
### Step 2: 
Create the list with the given coordinates.
### Step 3:  
Substitute the values in the distance formula

import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print(f"{d:.2f}")
```
